<p>Candidate Statements:</p>

<a name="Corso" id="Corso"></a>
<p>Alexandre Corso</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Alexandre Corso is working at Meta as Edge Delivery Manager. Previously, he was the peering manager and automation leader at AS35280 at Acorus Networks/Volterra/F5. In the past he has worked at France-IX as network engineer.
</p>
<p>
Since the beginning of his career, he has been involved in Peering communities in various ways: He has created technical tools for peering automation, he is well known in the peering circles, and he has served as a co-chair of the program committee of the Global Peering Forum.
</p>
<p>
Alexandre highly appreciates the value of PeeringDB, as not only he uses its services for his day-to-day job, but also he is introducing them to anyone that wants to improve their knowledge on peering.
</p>
<p>
As valuable as it is, unfortunately PeeringDB is not yet recognized in countries with a great potential in peering development (e.g. India, Indonesia, Thailand, etc.). If Alexandre is elected, he will continue the great work done until now on engagement and focus on the expansion of the usage and visibility of PeeringDB services in such countries.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, he will make strong efforts to enhance the stability of PeeringDB services. PeeringDB services are largely trusted by ISPs, cloud providers and other parties as a source of truth. Instability of these services may impact not only network automation but also the peering relationships of the parties involved. Therefore, stability and accessibility are keys elements to Alexandreâ€™s candidacy.

<p>Aaron Hughes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Aaron Hughes is the current elected Vice President of PeeringDB. In his prior terms, he has worked with the Board of Directors, Officers, and supporting volunteers to establish the organization, its bylaws, articles of incorporation, file for and have approved 501(c)(6) status, establish supporting processes, form supporting committees, establish and maintain a budget, setup contracts with vendors, and attract sponsors to support the organization. He has managed the budget well, leaving the organization with zero debt and a healthy outlook. He has also worked with the PeeringDB Product Committee to connect with the community on driving the future of the PeeringDB platform as well as facilitated its open sourcing. If re-elected, he will continue to work with the team to ensure the longevity of the organization utilizing community input and experience.
</p>
<p>
Aaron is also the President and CEO of 6connect, a leader in network provisioning automation including global resource management of IPv6/IPv4 Addressing, DNS/DNSSEC control for Service Providers and Enterprises, as well as peering automation. He is deeply rooted in community supporting organizations such as ARIN, NANOG, RIPE, APNIC, OpenIX, CaribNOG, and peering communities around the globe. Aaron has held network and system architecture and Sr. level management roles at Lockheed Martin, Cariden Technologies, Terremark, Certainty Solutions, UnitedLayer, Quest Technologies, RCN, UltraNet, and Channel(1) Communications among others. In addition, he helped found the Best Current Operational Practices (BCOP) forum and was elected to the ARIN Board of Trustees in 2012 and the OpenIX Board in 2016.

<p>Guillaume Mazoyer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As a network engineer who managed several networks at different scales, I understand how critical PeeringDB has become over the years. It is clear that PeeringDB now plays a pivotal role in facilitating peering globally. My role as developer of the Peering Manager open source project also makes me believe that the independence, neutrality and usability of PeeringDB lead it to be one of the most valuable directories in the industry. Peering Manager relies heavily on the data provided by PeeringDB, underscoring the indispensable nature of this platform in facilitating efficient and effective peering relationships.
</p>
<p>
I now work as a network automation developer in my day-to-day job and still serve as the maintainer and lead developer of Peering Manager, open source project.
</p>
<p>
I hope that I will be able to contribute even more to the Internet community if people decide to place their trust in my candidacy.

<blockquote>
<p>
PeeringDB continues to be one of the most important online resources for
network operators. I like that it operates as an independent entity, is
free of charge, neutral and foremost: a practical tool for everyday use.
The Internet's foundational infrastructure needs directories such as
PeeringDB to find networks to facilitate interconnection. PeeringDB is a
critical index.
</p>
<p>
In my day-to-day I work for Fastly and currently serve on the PeeringDB
board, amongst other community elected or appointed positions.
</p>
<p>
I believe I can contribute to the Internet ecosystem if I continue to
serve on the PeeringDB board. I hope to be given the trust and
opportunity for another term!
