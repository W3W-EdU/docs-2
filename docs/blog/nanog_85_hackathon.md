# NANOG 85 Hackathon Project

We’re bringing a project to the NANOG 85 Hackathon on 4-5 June.

This time we’re looking for your help in developing a proof of concept we can later develop into a full implementation. In exchange, we’ll walk you through what PeeringDB does. We’ll explain how we support different parts of the Internet community. And you can choose some PeeringDB swag as a thank you!

We’re looking for help both from people who want to help turn a flowchart into a designed tool and those who can code ([Python and Django](https://docs.peeringdb.com/howto/get-started-developing/)) and. If you can see yourself in one of those roles then let us know at <productcom@lists.peeringdb.com> and [register for the Hackathon](https://nanog.org/events/future/).

## What’s the project?
When we [published our updated guidelines](https://docs.peeringdb.com/committee/admin/approval-guidelines/) for registering in PeeringDB we noted that some of the processes would need to be automated. We want to automate the attestation process for confirming new interconnection facilities. This is a new process to let users confirm that an interconnection facility is real and offers relevant services.

It’s a simple workflow.

## What will you learn?
We’ll make sure that you have a good understanding of PeeringDB’s structure. You’ll learn what a network is - in PeeringDB. And we’ll also explain about Internet Exchange Points and interconnection facilities.

And you’ll get a good understanding of how and why people use PeeringDB. 

## What will we test together?
We want to look at ways that facility operators could activate the process. How should they get the unique URL? Do we need to implement ways for them to share it? What should PeeringDB users see when they visit the URL? Should we implement [#1156](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/1156)?

## What will success look like?
Success is helping people understand PeeringDB and using that to work out how our tool needs to work. Getting some proof of concept code running would be nice. But identifying issues to take account of in a future feature design would be a win, too. Introducing new people to PeeringDB and getting them involved in extending it is a win for us!

If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our low traffic [mailing lists](/#mailing-lists) or create an issue directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues). If you find a data quality issue, please let us know at [support@peeringdb.com](mailto:support@peeringdb.com).

--- 

PeeringDB is a freely available, user-maintained, database of networks, and the go-to location for interconnection data. The database facilitates the global interconnection of networks at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), data centers, and other interconnection facilities, and is the first stop in making interconnection decisions.
