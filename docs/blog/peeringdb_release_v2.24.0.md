# PeeringDB Release v2.24.0

PeeringDB is pleased to announce the release of v2.24.0.  Summary release notes are published on the [release notes page](https://docs.peeringdb.com/release_notes/). This release focuses on improving data quality in the database by improving the way networks can identify themselves and making the user interface clearer where people misunderstood what was meant.

Specialist networks can now identify themselves better. Governments, Route Collectors and organizations providing specialized Network Services, such as DNS, RDAP, or DDoS Protection can say so in their network type. We have cleaned up the data to reflect this for existing networks.  

Some users misunderstood the maximum prefix limit to mean the maximum prefix length. The tooltip now makes it clear that this refers to the maximum number of prefixes and not the prefix length.

While our [anonymous 2020 User Satisfaction Survey](https://surveyhero.com/c/f7be5236) is still open, we can already see that weâ€™ll need to make more improvements along these lines. If you have not yet completed the survey, please do. It takes under three minutes and will help us build our product roadmap for the next year.

If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our [low traffic mailing lists](https://docs.peeringdb.com/#mailing-lists) or create an issue directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb). If you find a data quality issue, please let us know at <support@peeringdb.com>.

The database facilitates the global interconnection of networks at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), data centers, and other interconnection facilities, and is the first stop in making interconnection decisions.
