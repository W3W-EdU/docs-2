# Advanced Search (Part 1)
You told us in [our 2020 survey](/blog/peeringdb_2020_satisfaction_survey/) that improving search was your top priority. That’s why we have been making [some database changes](/blog/geographic_search/) to support better search. In a recent release we rolled out changes that significantly improve the performance of our advanced search feature.

Advanced search now lets you explicitly filter searches location, network presence, service level and a wide range of other features. You get the results you’re looking for and can export them in structured data formats, so you can import the data into tools that will help you make decisions.

We are continuing to work on improvements to the advanced search options. We will then turn our focus to the default search. This set of improvements to search will build on the work we delivered earlier in the year and allow more geographically targeted searches.

Take a look at the advanced search feature and try it for yourself!

If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our [low traffic mailing lists](https://docs.peeringdb.com/#mailing-lists) or create an issue directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb). If you find a data quality issue, please let us know at <support@peeringdb.com>.
