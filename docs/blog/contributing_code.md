# Contributing Code to PeeringDB Just Got Easier

Have you ever wanted to contribute code to improve PeeringDB but found it too challenging to set up a test environment? The good news is that spinning up a development environment is now radically simplified.

We have made it much easier for volunteer developers to contribute code to PeeringDB. Until now, even if a code fix was relatively simple, the process for testing it before making the contribution was a challenge. Now, you can spin up a PeeringDB development instance in a couple of minutes. You’ll be able to test changes locally and then submit pull requests when you’re ready to publish your contribution.

Andy Davidson, CTO of Asteroid says: “*I recently developed some code against the PeeringDB OAuth instance for [https://trackbgp.com](https://trackbgp.com). But it was hard to get a development environment set up. Now I can spin up a development environment in less time than it takes to boil a kettle.*”

[We have documented](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/blob/master/docs/container.md) the steps needed to get up and running on GitHub.

If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our [low traffic mailing lists](https://docs.peeringdb.com/#mailing-lists) or create an issue directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb). If you find a data quality issue, please let us know at <support@peeringdb.com>.

PeeringDB is a freely available, user-maintained, database of networks, and the go-to location for interconnection data. The database facilitates the global interconnection of networks at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), data centers, and other interconnection facilities, and is the first stop in making interconnection decisions.
