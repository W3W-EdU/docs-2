# Release Schedule
This page provides planned dates for PeeringDBâ€™s future releases. We are sharing these dates to help PeeringDB users plan ahead for testing new and improved features in beta. We also want to help volunteer developers know the date on which their code changes are needed for internal testing before beta release.

We provide a rolling six months schedule. Dates can change, so if you have a question or request please contact us at: [support@peeringdb.com](mailto:support@peeringdb.com).
