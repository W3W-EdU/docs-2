## Introduction to PeeringDB
PeeringDB is a publicly available network database that is the go-to location for interconnection data. The database facilitates global network connections at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), data centers, and other interconnection facilities, and it serves as a starting point for interconnection decisions.

This online database is a non-profit, community-driven effort that encourages the exchange of Peering-related information and is totally managed and maintained by volunteers. It's a tool for the Internet's growth and enhancement.

## Why use PeeringDB to search for Networks, Exchange and Data Centers.

There are a number of Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) known as networks that use PeeringDB to store their interconnection information. Using PeeringDB, you'll be able to access and search for information about other networks requesting interconnection.  If you contribute your own data to PeeringDB it's also possible for them to find out about your own network details. There is no need to create an account in order to use the basic search functionality. But if you want to access private contact information and use advanced search features, like radius search,you'll need to sign up for an account.
By using PeeringDB, data centers referred to as Facilities and Internet exchange points (IXs) can increase their visibility to potential and existing customers by adding or updating their records in the database, making it significantly easier for networks to access information about their service.
